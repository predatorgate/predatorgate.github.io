Among millions of people, it would probably be astronomically [unlikely] for it to be a random event."" During her surveillance, her directorate was investigating, among other things, the murder of G. Karaivaz. During the same period she had received a death threat, while the then Hellenic Police (ELAS) Chief, Michalis Karamalakis, whom she informed about every development in the Karaivaz case, had been targeted by Predator in January 2021. P. Miniati stressed that the Karaivaz murder had been put ""on priority"" and that ""they had to either change my position or retire me"", as happened in spring 2022.

We never saw any files."" Mr. Rammos added that the Authority for Communication Security and Privacy (ADAE) twice summoned Evangelia Georgakopoulou, the Greek Intelligence Service (EYP) official allegedly responsible for transferring material from Predator surveillance to G.

Ms Triantafyllou testified that the Greek Intelligence Service (EYP) gave a monthly stipend of 500 euros to Konstantinos Petrissis, friend of Aimilios Kosmidis, whose card was used to send Predator messages to politicians and reporters. She stressed that ""the government and EYP knew what the Israelis were doing in Greece because of their work permits as specialized personnel"" and added that ""Intellexa had preferential treatment from the government. (...) It received permits for its employees and for Predator export in record time."" According to Ms Triantafyllou: ""Initially it was an informal partnership between public and private entities and from 2021 onwards the system passed into EYP's hands. KETYAK was the central installation point, this is what we have understood. It's not speculation, it's information we gathered from various sources."" Ms Triantafyllou said ""if the government didn't know about Predator, it would have moved heaven and earth to find those responsible,"" while in reality the government did not impose sanctions on Intellexa, like the US did, nor did the Authorities request information from Meta.",https://linkmix.co/49893144,46035,0daf3b61

According to the documents read, former Greek Intelligence Service (EYP) director Panagiotis Kontoleon told the Parliamentary Committee on wiretapping that EYP had ""excellent"" contact with the Authority for Communication Security and Privacy (ADAE) during the investigation of the scandal. This contrasts with the fact that the government illegally replaced two ADAE members who were about to decide, with the other members of the Plenary, on imposing a 100,000 euro fine on EYP for refusing to provide information during investigations to elucidate the wiretapping scandal.

According to the documents, between 2/6/2020-16/12/2021, 165 transactions were made. This exposes Supreme Court Deputy Prosecutor Achilleas Zisis, who had archived the complaints of N. Androulakis and Th. Koukakis against Aim. Kosmidis based on only two card transactions, since he himself had requested from the National Bank the card's movements for only seven days (16.9.2021 - 23.9.2021) and not for the entire period of its use (without justification). During the archiving, Mr Zisis had maintained that Mr Kosmidis had ""no relation [...] with any person at EYP or KETYAK,"" a fact contradicted by Aim. Kosmidis himself at the 24th hearing, as well as that ""a third party used the card,"" although the National Bank itself has stated that a card can only be activated by its beneficiary through identification by SMS to their mobile. It was also noted that transactions stopped on the day (16/12/2021) that Citizen Lab and Meta revealed Predator use in Greece and the same day Intellexa abruptly removed its servers from a data center in Maroussi.",https://linkmix.co/50353472,46048,52252132

Mr. Kyriakidis and N. Orfanidou (also Mr. Bitzios's lawyer) confirmed authorisations by Mr. Bitzios for Intellexa actions at EFKA (Social Insurance Institution) and Mr. Bitzios's signature on an employee employment contract with Intellexa. They also acknowledged that in 2020 Mr. Bitzios's Layth Capital subleased property at 5 Hephaestus Street in Marousi to Krikel for €5,000 per month, while also confirming agreements and loan contracts between companies of the two defendants. The Bitzios side acknowledged that his departure from Intellexa SA was backdated to 4.8.2022, just one day before the wiretapping scandal broke and the subsequent Dimitriadis-Kontoleontos resignations, without however providing minutes for his retroactive departure. Furthermore, the Bitzios side did not submit his emails with Sara Hamou and Tal Dilian.",https://x.com/reporters_gr/status/2016612119362388161,46050,4620d8a6

Specifically, he claimed he prepared a technical report for Intellexa evaluating the case file, without knowing Predator, without knowing ""the range of Intellexa's products,"" without receiving or requesting code for any company product. The witness also claimed he works for Mr. Dilian's lawyer and ""not for Intellexa,"" without however mentioning his invoice to Intellexa for 6,200 euros. The witness also challenged the credibility of Citizen Lab, while admitting that he himself has no training in malware analysis and that he included in his report for Intellexa assessments from Twitter (X) accounts. At the same hearing, the lawyers for Predator victims submitted a letter from lawyer Alexandros Sinkas to the European Parliament's PEGA Committee, documenting Mr. Bitzios's acquaintance with the nephew and former General Secretary of the Prime Minister Gr.

The prosecutor stated that the use of Predator was ""absolutely illegal"" and a ""threat to the core of the democratic system,"" as it gave ""powers to individuals who should not have had them."" The prosecutor said that ""the present case is not for a single-member court,"" essentially stating that they should have been tried as felonies rather than misdemeanors. He added that ""any use of Predator by intelligence services should be a wake-up call"" and that ""Predator is not available to private individuals, but is sold only to state services."" He also commented negatively on the defendants' absence from the trial, while dismantling the attempt to challenge Citizen Lab's credibility. Furthermore, the prosecutor said: ""The sending of an infected link is an attempt, as we have all the elements of the crime and the only thing required from the victim is to click on the link, i.e., a small, imperceptible act. Such a fabrication of false facts to the victim cannot be considered a mere preparatory act,"" as the defendants had argued.",https://linkmix.co/50785314,46059,0f7af9b1
10/2/2026,"35th hearing: Lawyers for the Predator victims, Zacharias Kesses and Petros Lianos, deliver their closing arguments. Z. Kesses spoke of an 'image of absolute decay' in the Greek Republic and journalism. Regarding the absence from the trial of New Democracy (ND) officials and military personnel who did not resort to Justice over their surveillance and were ultimately rewarded with government positions, he said that 'I can only think of blackmail or collusion'. He also added how the former Supreme Court prosecutor, Isidoros Dogiakos, 'was conspicuous by his absence' from the investigation of the wiretaps, except for the times he intervened to cover them up, while he analysed how the Supreme Court prosecution removed the wiretapping case from the competent prosecutors while they were investigating the existence of a joint EYP-Predator hub. P. Lianos argued that 'Intellexa did not operate as a simple private technology company, but in full partnership with EYP, so as to create a coordinated EYP-Predator surveillance hub'. He added that 'those involved developed a God complex. They felt invincible. They continued their activities without pretences. The godparent relationships between Dimitriadis-Lavranou and Lavranou-Bitziou occurred after the scandal broke in 2022'.",https://x.com/reporters_gr/status/2021319718125158529,46063,a8ee1d91

Christos Kaklamanis stated that ""as early as July 2022, Nikos Androulakis reported in a documented manner the offence under Article 292A of the Penal Code [Crimes against the security of telephone communications] in his complaint to the Supreme Court. However, Deputy Prosecutor Achilleas Zisis did not mention this specific felony in his report"" and that ""we have what is provided for in Article 292A PC and Article 134 PC [for high treason]."" Mr. Kaklamanis also asked the presiding judge to refer the case for re-examination, so that the possible commission of the felony under Article 292A PC could be investigated anew, adding that ""the Zisis report no longer exists as a credible document. The evidentiary proceedings and the witnesses before your court demolished it like a wrecking ball."" Flora Tabaki (lawyer for Nikos Androulakis) requested that the defendants be found guilty of all their punishable acts in serial form, as well as the investigation of possible criminal liability of butcher Aimilios Kosmidis. Artemisia Papadaki also requested an upgrade of the charges to felony level ""for attempted espionage (Article 148 PC), as Predator gained access to state secrets and specifically to emails of former minister Mr. Spirtzis, which concerned the country's negotiations with EU institutions, state security infrastructure such as flight radars, as well as a confidential telegram from a Greek embassy regarding the direct air connection between Athens and New York."" Finally, Sokratis Charalampous, lawyer for Stefanos Chios (and his associate Panagiotis Zarkadas), also called for the conviction of the defendants in his closing argument.",https://x.com/reporters_gr/status/2022273255336223193,46065,74b695b6
16/2/2026,"37th hearing: Felix Bitzios's lawyers, Niki Orfanidou and Yiannis Kyriakidis, deliver their closing arguments. The two lawyers turned against the media that exposed the surveillance operations. ""I respect journalists for their work. However, in this case they did not grasp subtle legal concepts and created a false picture, which they introduced into the court and ultimately believed themselves,"" Mr. Kyriakidis said; ""all the sources of the press reports are completely anonymous and unverifiable, which makes it impossible to verify their reliability and the truth of the reported events. [...] The reports do not constitute independent evidence. [...] They incorporate subjective judgments and not judicially established facts. [...] They have not been collected in accordance with the prescribed procedural guarantees,"" Ms. Orfanidou argued. The lawyers did not align themselves with the prosecutor's recommendation (for conviction), while they maintained that their client was not de facto an administrator in any of the companies mentioned in the indictment. Mr. Kyriakidis argued that the court should not take into account the Predator messages allegedly sent to persons who did not appear at the trial to confirm their targeting. Mr. Kyriakidis acknowledged two completed surveillance operations via Predator (Koukakis and Siford) and another seven Predator message transmissions, one of which occurred while Mr. Bitzios was still at Intellexa.",https://x.com/reporters_gr/status/2023503020592693380,46069,2667a179
17/2/2026,"38th hearing: Lawyers for three defendants (G. Lavranos, T. Dilian, S. Chamou) deliver their closing arguments: Dionysis Mataragkas, Eleftheria Rizou, and Andreas Mitsainas. The lawyers argued that their clients should be acquitted of all charges, citing evidence of a common EYP-Predator centre to support the claim that the defendants, unlike the state, are not connected to the illegal software. Specifically, Mr. Mataragkas said that ""there is the narrative about a common Greek Intelligence Service (EYP)-Predator centre, with simultaneous surveillance and an operational centre at KETIAK. However, this narrative also says that Predator is sold only to governments and not to private individuals. And this does not serve the indictment, since it does not prove any direct perpetration by Ms. Chamou and Mr. Dilian,"" while Ms. Rizou stated that ""all indications support that the Greek authorities procured and used Predator."" Ms. Rizou also said that ""the chief prosecutor is seeking the conviction of Mr. Lavranos as de facto manager of Krikel, which is connected to Intellexa through transactions and export licenses to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This transcendent conception of guilt is unprecedented for a criminal trial. [...] In this trial, Mr. Lavranos was accused of many things, of false identities, of cronyism, of relationships with politicians, of allegedly going to Israel with a fake passport on an official state mission. However, even the most vehement accusers of Mr. Lavranos could not attribute to him any charge related to Predator and said absolutely nothing about the wiretapping."" Finally, Ms. Rizou said that the journalists who investigated the scandal ""lacked the greatest quality of a journalist, objectivity,"" while Mr. Mataragkas also argued that investigative journalism was mobilised as the ""absolute tool"" to develop the ""narrative of private individual involvement"" in Predator.",https://x.com/reporters_gr/status/2023851208361079073,46070,f9cadadd

For the first two acts, the court adopted the prosecutor's proposal, which recommended conversion from continuous to concurrent offences. The court rejected mitigating factors and sentenced the defendants to a total of 126 years and 8 months (8 years to be served). The court ordered full service of the sentence, but granted suspension until the case is heard on appeal, provided the defendants file an appeal. The court accepted the prosecutor's proposal to refer the case file for investigation of criminal liability: (1) for the offence of Article 148 of the Penal Code (espionage); (2) for the offence of Penal Code 370 F (prohibition of software trafficking); (3) referral for Aimilios Kosmidis for complicity in the acts of the indictment; (4) investigation of the offence of false testimony in court for A. Kosmidis and S. Dalas; (5) assessment of criminal liability of persons who had full knowledge of what was happening, specifically Rotem Farkas, Merom Harpaz, Einat Semana (senior executive of Dilian's affiliated companies), Sotiris Dalas, as well as three Intellexa employees (Dimitris Xypteras, Ioannis Toumpis, Ioannis Boliaris); (6) referral for expansion regarding what Stamatis Trimpalis testified about the parliamentary inquiry committee proceedings for false testimony and moral authorship for G. Lavranos and S. Dalas; (7) referral for Konstantinos Petridis (friend of A. Kosmidis who was paid by the Greek Intelligence Service (EYP)).
